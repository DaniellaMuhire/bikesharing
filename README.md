# bikesharing

## Overview of the project

In this module, we use tableau to visualize bike-sharing data in New York City. More precisely, we want to know how the bike business actually works in New York City for the month of August.

## Results

In this image, we can see that we have a total of 2,344,224 trips recorded during the month of August.

In this visualization, we graph the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders. As we can see, bikes are mosty checkout for 4 to hours.

In this visualization, we graph the length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender. We can see that male take more times than female.

In this visualization, we graph the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap. We can see that during the week, most rides are between 5a.m to 9a.m and 5p.m to 7p.m.

In this visualization, we graph the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as a heatmap. We can see most rides of the week are taken by men.

In this visualization, we have a heatmap that shows the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each Usertype. We can see that most subscribers to the program are MALE.

## Summary
The results show that most of the subscribers are men, which could explain the fact that they cycle more often and for longer periods than women.

For future analysis, we can include weather data and create a visualization of the weather data and number of rides. We could also include other months of the year to see which months is more likely to have more riders.
